Hi, Shiona,
How are you? It was great to get your email last week. How is the new job? I hope it’s going very well.

I’m now living in New York and I’m studying English for the summer. This has been my dream for years. It’s really hard work, but it is interesting. I’m also taking the time to learn about New York. I’m visiting interesting places and meeting new people. I hope to see some shows.

Last week I went to an art exhibit. It was really fascinating. I’m not keen on modern art, but I really liked some of the paintings.

Have to go now but will write again next week.

Take care,
AnHui
