Margaret went to a focus group at the Company Company. She did not have a good experience. She wrote to Marco about it. First, too many people were invited. It was too noisy. Also, the room wasn’t big enough, and there weren’t enough chairs. The room was too hot. The focus group was too long. The instructions weren’t clear, so she didn’t know what to do. There weren’t enough new products, so she couldn’t say much about the product.
