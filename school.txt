My name’s Adam, and I go to a language school to learn French. 
There’s a very good French school in my town. I’m interested in learning French because I like French movies and French food. 
I also want to get a certificate in French, so I can teach it to other students. French is not difficult to understand now, but it was at first. I’m taking reading, writing, and speaking classes. There’s a language center at the school. I practice my listening skills there. It’s hard to study for the exams because I also have a job. However, I’m getting As! I want to speak French really well, so I can teach others. I think it would be great for me to be a teacher.
