Julia: Hi, Lee. The police are in front of the restaurant. Did you see?
Leah: Yes. I saw three police officers in front.
Julia: Do you know what happened?
Leah: I do. They arrested a man.
Julia: Why did they arrest him?
Leah: I’m not sure… something about a stolen credit card.
Julia: Really? Here at this restaurant?
Leah: Yes. The waitress called the police.
Julia: Where is the man now?
Leah: I think he’s in the back of the police car.
