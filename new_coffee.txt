Emilia: I went to the new cafe on Bridge Street last night 
Tariq: Oh really? Did you like it?
Emilia: Yes, it was good, but there weren't enough tables.
Tariq: I agree. They need a bigger place. What about the food and drink?
Emilia: It was OK, but I didn’t like the coffee.
Tariq: Why do you say that? I thought it tasted really good.
Emilia: Because it was too hot.
Tariq: Oh，I didn’t drink it immediately. What did you think about the price? 
Emilia: It was a little bit expensive.
Tariq: I agree with you. $6 for coffee is too much.
