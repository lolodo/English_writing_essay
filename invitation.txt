Dear Jian,
How’s it going? I hope you’re well.Guess what? I’m writing to invite you to a party next Saturday. The party is for our friend Annika. We are celebrating her visit from India. The party starts at 7:00 p.m. Please let me know if you can come. I miss you, so I hope you can make it. 

All the best, 
Beth

Dear Becca,
 
Please come to a birthday party on June 16 at 7:00 p.m. at my house on 27 Haskell Street, Cambridge. Bob doesn’t know about the party, so please don’t tell him. I want to surprise him. 
 
There is not much parking in my neighborhood, so it is best to come by bus or by bike. If you choose to drive, there is some parking at the end of the street.
 
Please let me know by the end of the week if you can come. Hope you can make it!
 
Best,
Ani
