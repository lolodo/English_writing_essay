Dear Jian,
How’s it going? I hope you’re well.Guess what? I’m writing to invite you to a party next Saturday. The party is for our friend Annika. We are celebrating her visit from India. The party starts at 7:00 p.m. Please let me know if you can come. I miss you, so I hope you can make it. 

All the best, 
Beth
