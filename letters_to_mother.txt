How's it going? I am so sorry I haven’t spoken to you in so long. I’m writing to tell you about a big decision I made. Guess what? I got a new job! I will be the assistant director at work. I wish I could write more, but I have my first big meeting with my new coworkers in 10 minutes! I’m busy, but I think of you a lot. I hope you are doing well. I’d love to hear from you, so please write back soon!
 

All the best,
Kellie
