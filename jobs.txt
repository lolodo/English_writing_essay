My name is Alex Liu and I live in Beijing, China. I recently started a new job. I'm an engineer at a large company. My new job is the most exciting job of all jobs I have had. The offce is much bigger and there are a lot more people. The computer system is much faster than in my old job. It's easier to get my work done. The people at my new job are the nicest people I have ever met. We works well together and we can solve problems faster as a team.

My old job was the most boring job ever! I'm glad I left my old job. I'm the happiest I have ever been.

My name is Susan Bell, and I go to college in sunny California now. Last year I went to college in New York, but my new college is much better. It has smarter students and friendlier students than my old college. Also, the teachers at my new college are the best teachers I have ever known. They have the most interesting classes and we have better discussions than we had at my old college. The work is harder here, but I do it faster because I like it more.
My old school is the biggest college in the country and has the most students. I like my new school because it has fewer students and I can make friends more easily. Also, the weather at my old school is the worst weather anywhere. It is always raining and cold. I am happy that I changed schools because the students are the smartest and friendliest, the classes are the most interesting, and the weather is warmest and sunniest anywhere.
