Dear Tom,


I’m back at home now. The trip back home was good.

I’m writing to thank you for having me at your home in Austin. You made my first visit to Texas very nice. I liked having meals with your family. You and your wife are great cooks! Your tips for getting around the city were really helpful, too. I really enjoyed sightseeing and meeting your friends in Austin.

I’m back at home now. Nancy and I are planning another trip because we just enjoy traveling so much. We are going to Bali next month! We’re flying there for a week. Before we go, I have to work! I’m doing a big presentation for my boss on Monday. I’m nervous.
Thanks again for your kind welcome. I know you are coming to Hong Kong this summer for business. Please call me when you get here. I’d love to show you around.


Best,
Daniel
